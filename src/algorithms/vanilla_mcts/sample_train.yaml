# Vanilla MCTS Training Configuration
# ===================================
# Demonstrates how to configure Vanilla MCTS (no neural networks)

game: tictactoe

algorithm:
  name: vanilla_mcts

  # Hardware device - kept for consistency but not used
  device: cpu

  # NO MODEL SECTION - this is the key difference from AlphaZero!

  # Validation settings
  num_test_games: 20           # Number of test games to run for validation
  random_seed: 42              # Random seed for reproducibility
  verbose: true                # Print progress

  # MCTS search parameters
  num_sims: 1000               # Simulations per move (higher = stronger but slower)
  c_exploration: 1.414         # UCB1 exploration constant (sqrt(2) is standard)
  max_rollout_depth: 100       # Max depth for random rollouts (null = unlimited)
  rollout_seed: 42             # Seed for rollout randomness
  illegal_action_penalty: 1000000000.0

# Notes:
# ------
# - No model section needed (pure algorithmic approach)
# - Agent strength comes from num_sims (more simulations = stronger)
# - c_exploration controls exploration/exploitation tradeoff
# - Trained "agent" is just these hyperparameters (saved in agent.yaml)
# - No model.pt file will be created
