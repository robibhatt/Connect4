# Connect4: AlphaZero vs Random Match
# ====================================
# Benchmark your trained Connect4 agent against a random player
# Great way to see how much your agent has learned

game: connect4

match:
  num_games: 50  # Fewer games than TicTacToe (Connect4 is slower)

# Agent 1: Trained AlphaZero agent
agent1:
  type: alphazero
  # Update this path to your trained agent checkpoint
  checkpoint_dir: saved_agents/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CHECKPOINT_DIR

# Agent 2: Random agent
agent2:
  type: random

# Notes:
# ------
# - Update checkpoint_dir to point to your trained Connect4 agent
# - Find checkpoints in: saved_agents/
# - A well-trained agent should win 95%+ of games
# - First player has advantage in Connect4
# - Use this to track training progress over time
# - Consider running more games (100+) for more accurate statistics
