# Connect4: AlphaZero vs AlphaZero Match
# =======================================
# Compare two trained Connect4 agents or different training checkpoints
# Useful for evaluating which model is stronger

game: connect4

match:
  num_games: 50  # Fewer games than TicTacToe (Connect4 is slower)

# Agent 1: First trained AlphaZero agent
agent1:
  type: alphazero
  # Update this path to your first trained agent checkpoint
  checkpoint_dir: saved_agents/REPLACE_WITH_CHECKPOINT_1

# Agent 2: Second trained AlphaZero agent
agent2:
  type: alphazero
  # Update this path to your second trained agent checkpoint
  checkpoint_dir: saved_agents/REPLACE_WITH_CHECKPOINT_2

# Notes:
# ------
# - Update both checkpoint_dir paths to trained Connect4 agents
# - Use cases:
#   - Compare different training runs
#   - Test earlier vs later checkpoints from same training
#   - Evaluate different hyperparameter settings
# - First player advantage is significant in Connect4
# - Win rate as both first and second player matters
# - Consider running more games (100+) for better statistics
