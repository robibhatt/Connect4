# Connect4: Random vs Random Match
# =================================
# Watch two random agents play Connect4 - works immediately!
# Useful for testing the simulate_match script

game: connect4

match:
  num_games: 50  # Fewer games than TicTacToe (Connect4 is slower)

# Agent 1: Random agent
agent1:
  type: random

# Agent 2: Random agent
agent2:
  type: random

# Notes:
# ------
# - No training required - this config works immediately
# - Connect4 games take longer than TicTacToe
# - Expect roughly 50/50 win rate between agents
# - Good for verifying the match simulation script works
# - Increase num_games for more accurate statistics
