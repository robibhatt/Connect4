# TicTacToe: AlphaZero vs Random Match
# ======================================
# Benchmark your trained agent against a random player
# Great way to see how much your agent has learned

game: tictactoe

match:
  num_games: 100  # Number of games to simulate

# Agent 1: Trained AlphaZero agent
agent1:
  type: alphazero
  # Update this path to your trained agent checkpoint
  checkpoint_dir: saved_agents/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CHECKPOINT_DIR

# Agent 2: Random agent
agent2:
  type: random

# Notes:
# ------
# - Update checkpoint_dir to point to your trained TicTacToe agent
# - Find checkpoints in: saved_agents/
# - A well-trained agent should win 90%+ of games as first player
# - First player advantage in TicTacToe means random can sometimes draw
# - Use this to track training progress over time
