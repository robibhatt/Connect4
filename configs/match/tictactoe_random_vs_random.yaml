# TicTacToe: Random vs Random Match
# ==================================
# Watch two random agents play each other - works immediately!
# Useful for testing the simulate_match script

game: tictactoe

match:
  num_games: 100  # Number of games to simulate

# Agent 1: Random agent
agent1:
  type: random

# Agent 2: Random agent
agent2:
  type: random

# Notes:
# ------
# - No training required - this config works immediately
# - Expect roughly 50/50 win rate between agents (with some draws)
# - Good for verifying the match simulation script works
# - Increase num_games for more accurate statistics
